This repository provides pretrained image encoders (from the Chg2Cap project) that can be reused for related tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). This repository has been extended with additional code and scripts to support VQA tasks as part of a course project for Columbia University's "Deep Learning for Computer Vision" course (COMS 4995).
